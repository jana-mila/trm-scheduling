**Goal:** Solve Job Shop scheduling with the objective to minimize makespan (total length of time from start of earliest job and end of last job) while adhering to precedence, disjunctive constraints using supervised learning technique particularly the [Tiny Recursive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871) proposed by Alexia.


## Data

Use `generate_data.py` to generate the problems and the solutions specifying number of problem instances, number of machines, jobs, and tasks for each instance and setting the maximum duration for each task. 

TODO: dataloaders in correct format for data training for TRM

## Model

TODO: format model architecture to allow training to solve the job shop problem
